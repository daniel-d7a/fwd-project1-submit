# Project Title

Landing page project

<!-- Add buttons here -->

<!-- Describe your project in brief -->

The project is about making a landing page and adding more interactivity to it like making it responsive and adding a dynamic navigation bar that addes links to every section dynamically as the page is built.

<!-- The project title should be self explanotory and try not to make it a mouthful. (Although exceptions exist- **awesome-readme-writing-guide-for-open-source-projects** - would have been a cool name)
Add a cover/banner image for your README. **Why?** Because it easily **grabs people's attention** and it **looks cool**(*duh!obviously!*).
The best dimensions for the banner is **1280x650px**. You could also use this for social preview of your repo.
I personally use [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/) for creating the banner images. All the basic stuff is **free**(*you won't need the pro version in most cases*).
There are endless badges that you could use in your projects. And they do depend on the project. Some of the ones that I commonly use in every projects are given below.
I use [**Shields IO**](https://shields.io/) for making badges. It is a simple and easy to use tool that you can use for almost all your badge cravings. -->

<!-- Some badges that you could use -->

<!-- ![GitHub release (latest by date including pre-releases)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme?include_prereleases)
: This badge shows the version of the current release.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: I think it is self-explanatory. This gives people an idea about how the project is being maintained.
![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-raw/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: This is a dynamic badge from [**Shields IO**](https://shields.io/) that tracks issues in your project and gets updated automatically. It gives the user an idea about the issues and they can just click the badge to view the issues.
![GitHub pull requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: This is also a dynamic badge that tracks pull requests. This notifies the maintainers of the project when a new pull request comes.
![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme/total): If you are not like me and your project gets a lot of downloads(*I envy you*) then you should have a badge that shows the number of downloads! This lets others know how **Awesome** your project is and is worth contributing to.
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/navendu-pottekkat/awesome-readme)
: This shows what kind of open-source license your project uses. This is good idea as it lets people know how they can use your project for themselves.
![Tweet](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url?style=flat-square&logo=twitter&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnavendu.me%2Fnsfw-filter%2Findex.html): This is not essential but it is a cool way to let others know about your project! Clicking this button automatically opens twitter and writes a tweet about your project and link to it. All the user has to do is to click tweet. Isn't that neat? -->

# Demo-Preview

![project demo](./demo.mp4)

<!-- After you have written about your project, it is a good idea to have a demo/preview(**video/gif/screenshots** are good options) of your project so that people can know what to expect in your project. You could also add the demo in the previous section with the product description.
Here is a random GIF as a placeholder.
![Random GIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/ZVik7pBtu9dNS/giphy.gif) -->

# Table of contents

<!-- After you have introduced your project, it is a good idea to add a **Table of contents** or **TOC** as **cool** people say it. This would make it easier for people to navigate through your README and find exactly what they are looking for.
Here is a sample TOC(*wow! such cool!*) that is actually the TOC for this README. -->

- [Project Title](#project-title)
- [Demo-Preview](#demo-preview)
- [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Development](#development)
- [Contribute](#contribute)
- [Contributions](#contributions)
- [Adding new features or fixing bugs](#adding-new-features-or-fixing-bugs)
- [License](#license)
- [Footer](#footer)

# Development

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.
You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.
You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.
Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->

If you want to know how the code works in order to modify it you can find the jsdoc file in the out folder _./out/global.html_

# Contribute

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is where you can let people know how they can **contribute** to your project. Some of the ways are given below.
Also this shows how you can add subsections within a section. -->

To contribute to this project please follow these instructions:-

1. first fork the project to your own account.
2. see the file hierarchy to know where to contribute: -

- _./index.html_ is the main html file.
- _./css/styles.css_ has the styles for the whole project.
- _./js/app.js_ has all the javascript for the project.

3. if you want to contribute please don't add new files, write your code under all the code in the current files.
4. test the code to see if all the main functionalities work. **any pull request that breakes the code will not be accepted**
5. test the code to see if the new features / styles / elements / ...etc you added are working. **any broken functionality will not be accepted**
6. add the jsdoc comments to your js code (if you added new code) then run jsdoc to generate the new documentation file and delete the old one. **any undocumented work will not be added**
7. add a brief of your contribution along with your name to the corresponding section below.

# Contributions

# Adding new features or fixing bugs

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

List of ideas for new features and/or fixes: -

- change the style of the website.
- link an actual api with actual sections of text instead of dummy text.
<!-- This is to give people an idea how they can raise issues or feature requests in your projects.
You could also give guidelines for submitting and issue or a pull request to your project.
Personally and by standard, you should use a [issue template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) and a [pull request template](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/blob/master/PULL_REQ_TEMPLATE.md)(click for examples) so that when a user opens a new issue they could easily format it as per your project guidelines.
You could also add contact details for people to get in touch with you regarding your project. -->

<!-- Let's also add a footer because I love footers and also you **can** use this to convey important info.
Let's make it an image because by now you have realised that multimedia in images == cool(*please notice the subtle programming joke). -->
